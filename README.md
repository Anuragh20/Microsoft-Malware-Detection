# Microsoft-Malware-Detection

Classify the family of Malware a given file belongs.

**Summary:**

The raw data comprises of two types of files: Byte files and ASM files and each set of these files belongs to one of the 9 families of Malware. The train dataset consists of 200 GB of data out of which 50 GB of data is byte files and 150 GB of data is ASM files. 

**Objective of the Activity:**

The primary objective of the task is a Multi Class classification. Given the associated bytes and asm representation of a file, the objective of the activity is to predict the probabilities of the file belonging to each of the 9 families of malware and assign the file to a single family basis probability.

**Procedure:**

1.	Byte Files:
    a)	Extracted bigrams from bytes files. Merged Bigrams and Unigrams from bytefiles and formed a single dataset. Performed TSNE to look at the distribution of the data. 
    b)	Used SVD to reduce the number of variables and shortlisted the n_components basis the variance ratio and the performance of the models after fitting each of the datasets         on various n_components of SVD. 
    c)	Applied ML models on bytes features -> KNNClassifier,Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

2.	ASM Files:
    a)	Performed Multi variate analysis on the ASM features using TSNE. 
    b)	Used SVD to reduce the number of variables and shortlisted the n_components basis the variance ratio 
    c)	Applied PCA to remove multicollinearity and also for variable reduction 
    d)	Applied ML models on ASM features -> K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.

3.	ByteFiles+ASM Files
    a)	Merged both ASM and Bytes features and Used SVD to reduce the number of variables and shortlisted the n_components basis the variance ratio 
    b)	Applied ML models -> Random Forest, XgBoost as they performed well on the Bytes and ASM files

4.	ByteFile+ASM Files+ASM Image
    a) Extracted ASM image features using https://github.com/be-shekhar/microsoft-malware-detection/blob/master/MicrosoftMalwareDetection.ipynb Merged ASM image features and            Bytes bi-grams and Applied Tuned Random Forest Classifier to further reduce log-loss.

5.	Unigram_byte_features + 2K_bigram_byte_features + ASM_features + 800_asm_features
